## Note for the readers

***This writing is based on the ISO/IEC 9889:2024 (C23) draft. It uses intuitive definitions to understand this topic.***

***This is a complex topic with edge cases. If you think that a fact is inaccurately represented, or the writing doesn't uphold the standards it is claiming, the author warmly welcomes all the suggestions and corrections. The communication can be done via Email, LinkedIn, or GitHub Discussions.***

## Expectations

This is an exploration of C variables, not a complete reference. It focuses on understanding a few of their properties in greater depth and seeing how those properties are reflected in compiler output and object files.

The examples use GCC, x86-64, and ELF. Some observations therefore describe how one particular toolchain implements C, rather than requirements imposed by the C standard.

The goal is not to cover every rule or edge case concerning C variables, but to develop a deeper understanding of the parts discussed here.

---

There are several properties associated with C variables that I want to track and understand better. They include:

1. **Scope:** *Where is the identifier available to be accessed?*
   1. The block it is declared in?
   2. The translation unit (TU) it is present in?
   3. All the translation units that constitute the program?

2. **Storage Location:** *Where in the memory the identifier will be given the storage?*
   1. **Stack**: It is a per-function storage, allocated/freed upon the creation/completion of a function.
   2. **Static Storage**: It's a storage with a duration equal to the program's execution.

3. **Storage Duration:** *How long the storage associated with an identifier should exist in memory?*
   1. Until the program execution is in the block the identifier is declared in?
   2. Until the program executes?
   3. Should it correspond one-to-one with scope, or should it be an independent property?

4. **Initial State:** *What is the initial value of the object if no initializer is provided?*

These things are explained by storage classes. Every identifier has a storage class, but not all identifiers have a storage class specifier in their declaration.

In my observation, I have noticed that storage class specifiers do more than defining the four aforementioned properties of an identifier. It is possible that I am missing something, in which case, I am open to better explanations to correct my mental model.

---

Below is a description of these storage class specifiers.

| Storage Class Specifier | Scope (Availability) | Storage Location | Storage Duration | Linkage | Value if no initializer is provided |
| :---------------------- | :------------------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :------ | :---------------------------------- |
| `auto` | Block scope | Automatic storage. More on this later. | Until execution is in the block the variable is defined in. | None | Indeterminate |
| `register` | Block Scope | Automatic storage | Automatic | None | Indeterminate |
| `static` | *Block scope* when the identifier is present in a block; *File scope* when the identifier is present globally in the file. | Static storage. Typically `.data` (if initialized), or `.bss` (if uninitialized, or zero-initialized) in ELF. | For the entire execution of the program. | *None* for block-static and *Internal* for file-static identifiers. | 0 |
| `extern` | N/A | Static storage. Typically `.data` (if initialized), or `.bss` (if uninitialized, or zero-initialized) in ELF. | For the entire execution of the program. | External | N/A |

## Notes

> 1. `register` is only a hint to the compiler. The compiler may still put the value in memory. Also, we can not use the "address of" operator (&) on such a declaration, as the object may or may not exist at a memory location.
> 
> 2. `extern` is slightly different from the rest of the specifiers. It is explored later.


The table is loaded with information. To understand it, we need a starting point.

A bare minimum declaration contains an identifier and its type. It doesn't advertise the aforementioned properties. However, we can find where it is declared by noticing the surrounding code. We will treat the location of a declaration as our starting point.

## Block-level declaration

An identifier declared inside a pair of curly-braces (functions, if-else, loops, and unnamed blocks, among others) has block scope.

The default storage class for block-scoped declarations is `auto`, which stands for "automatic storage". Usually it is stack, but it could be a register or it could be completely optimized by the compiler.

The actual storage location depends on multiple things. In my observation, I have found two factors influencing it. They are **program complexity** and **optimization level**.
  - Program complexity directly affects the register pressure. A complicated program with multiple live values might force the compiler to use stack, as keeping values live in registers increases "register pressure".
  - If the code is simple enough, the compiler might use registers instead of stack at higher optimization levels (--O1 and beyond).

`auto` is implicit, which is why no one specifies it. So, `{auto int x = 45;}` and `{int x = 45;}` are identical.

The default behavior can be overridden with `static`. It increases the storage duration of the object, but the availability of its identifier remains limited to the block it is defined in.

---

Therefore, identifiers declared in a block are available only in its boundaries. Their storage duration, however, depends on their storage class.

It is reasonable to think that the storage associated with an automatic block-scoped object is discarded once execution leaves the block. It is not wrong, but it is incomplete. We will explore it from assembly's point of view to complete it.

## File Scope

An identifier declared outside of all the functions is a file-scoped declaration. For example, both `pi_1` and `pi_2` are file-scoped declarations here.
```c
/* math1.c */
#include <stdio.h>

float pi_1 = 3.14;
static float pi_2 = 3.14;

int main(void);
```

As named, a file-scoped declaration is available within its translation unit only. However, it can be made globally available as well.

---

In the example above, `pi_1` is globally available and `pi_2` is local to its translation unit. Before going into the details, take this scenario.
  - We have a file named `math2.c`. It wants to use `pi_1` which is defined in `math1.c`.
  - How should `math2.c` communicate to the toolchain (gcc/clang) that it wants to use a variable defined in a different TU? The answer is `extern`. The snippet below demonstrates this.

```c
/* math2.c */
#include <stdio.h>

extern float pi_1;

int main(void){
  printf("%f\n", pi_1);
}
```

The `extern` specifier tells the toolchain that this declaration refers to an object with external linkage, whose definition is provided elsewhere. This is made clear later in the examples section.

If you notice, a block-scoped object is available and accessible within its block; a file-static object is available and accessible within the TU. *While an object with external linkage is available across all the TUs, it is not accessible by default.*

That's why `extern` feels slightly awkward. It is not similar to other storage class specifiers.

---

It's time to explore the perspective of assembly. It is necessary as C is compiled to assembly and both the languages have different models to express the same intent. Exploring assembly will complete our mental model.

## Assembly Context

Assembly doesn't have scopes the way C has. It has symbols and those symbols have a few properties. The ones that interest us includes **visibility** and **cross-file name resolution**, which is used by the linker to perform relocations.

To understand these properties, we have to understand **linkage**.

***If I use one identifier across multiple translation units, do they refer to the same object, or different ones?*** This is what linkage answers.

There are three types of linkage: external, internal, and none.
  - With external linkage (STB_GLOBAL), an identifier refers to the same object across all the TUs constituting the program.
  - At file scope, a declaration of an identifier with the `static` specifier has internal linkage. It refers to the same object throughout the translation unit and that identifier is visible within that TU only.
  - Automatic variables have no linkage. **The why is unclear to me at this moment.** It may be due to the fact that they cease to exist after the stack frame associated with them is released, so there is no point of assigning a linkage to them as they are transient given to the program's lifespan.

Therefore, from the perspective of assembly, either a symbol is available to the whole program, or the assembly file it is defined in. But as we have discussed, `availability != accessibility`.
  - A symbol has to be available to be accessible.
  - If a symbol is available, it could still be inaccessible for some reason.

---

We can notice that there is no block scope in assembly. Then how the compiler translates automatic storage and block-level availability of C objects?
  - We use a toolchain like GCC or Clang to build a C source code. It controls all the steps in the build process. It generates an assembly which conforms to the C language rules.
  - The process is controlled end-to-end, so there is no way an instruction is emitted that accesses a block-scoped declaration outside of the equivalent assembly code, unless the toolchain has a bug.

Does that mean.....
  - I can stop gcc/clang after compilation (or invoke the preprocessor and compiler manually and stop there),
  - check if stack is used to store a block-scoped variable,
  - if yes, then manipulate the assembly to access it outside its block while ensuring that the storage corresponding to the variable still exists and has not been reused, and
  - expect it to run the intended way?

Absolutely. If the conditions were right, the program is likely to execute the intended way. Example #8 demonstrated this.

Isn't this problematic? It is. But as said, the toolchain controls all the steps. As long as it is not buggy, it should be alright. Moreover, if we write assembly manually, we are likely to exhibit similar behavior, as accessing a variable outside of its intended scope is problematic in general.

---

From the perspective of C, it is reasonable to assume that leaving a block ends the lifetime of all the automatic objects in it. From the perspective of the generated assembly, however, the stack storage containing its old value may still physically exist, whether it remains unchanged or it is reused is a separate discussion.

In ordinary functions without dynamic stack allocation (VLA), the compiler often reserves the space required by every declaration in the function at once. This includes the storage needed by nested blocks as well.

The compiler normally doesn't emit a separate stack adjustment when a nested block ends. The compiler adjusts (release) the stack once-for-all when the function returns. **Please note that this is an observed behavior.**

Just like a programmer writing assembly manually ensures that symbols are used within the intended blocks of code, even when there is no such rule, the programmer can adjust the stack pointer to conceptually represent creation/termination of C-style blocks.

It is reasonable to ask why the compiler doesn't do what a programmer can do manually. **I don't have an answer here.** Maybe the engineers who build these compilers, or the researchers in this field can answer it better. However, performance could be one of the factors influencing this.
  - Adjusting the stack pointer may not be an expensive operation, but when done repeatedly may introduce unintended effects on the performance.
  - To adjust rsp after each block, the compiler has to keep track of the total allocation size in every block.
  - Dynamic stack allocation, or VLAs, further complicates this.

---

To solidify our understanding, here are a few examples.

## Examples

To compile C to x86-64 assembly, we will use GCC with the following flags.
```bash
$ gcc main.c -S -o main.s \ 
   -masm=intel -fno-ident \
   -fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables -fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm
```

They are used to generate a clean assembly:
  - `-masm=intel` instructs GCC to generate intel syntax assembly, although the directives remain GAS (GNU as) specific.
  - `-fno-ident` disables the generation of .ident assembler directives.
  - `-fno-asynchronous-unwind-tables` disables the generation of the .eh_frame section in the binary.
  - `-fno-dwarf2-cfi-asm` tells the compiler to omit DWARF2 Call Frame Information (CFI) assembler directives (.cfi_startproc, .cfi_endproc, etc.).

**Note: I have used whitespace and empty newlines to improve the readability of the assembly output. The content remains unchanged.**

### #1. Automatic Storage

**Expectations**:

- At -O0, the compiler aims to preserve the exact program semantics. Often times, stack is used here. But it is an observed behavior.

- At -O1, the compiler looks for optimizations. If the logic is simple enough, it may promote certain memory-based accesses to register.
**

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
  int num = 4;
  printf("num %d\n", num);
}
```

Assembly at -O0:
```asm
	.text
	.section .rodata
.LC0:
	.string	 "num %d\n"

	.text
	.globl main
	.type	 main, @function
main:
	push rbp
	mov  rbp, rsp
	sub  rsp, 16

	mov  DWORD PTR -4[rbp], 4
	mov  eax, DWORD PTR -4[rbp]
	mov  esi, eax        ; arg3
	lea  rax, .LC0[rip]
	mov  rdi, rax        ; arg2
	mov  eax, 0          ; arg1
	call printf@PLT

	mov  eax, 0
	leave
	ret
```
  - Stack is used.

Assembly at -O1:
```asm
	.text
	.section .rodata.str1.1, "aMS", @progbits, 1
.LC0:
	.string  "num %d\n"

	.text
	.globl main
	.type	 main, @function
main:
	sub  rsp, 8
	mov  esi, 4            ; arg3
	lea  rdi, .LC0[rip]    ; arg2
	mov  eax, 0            ; arg1
	call printf@PLT

	mov	eax, 0
	add	rsp, 8
	ret
```
  - A register is used.

### #2. Register

**Expectation**: We can not use the "address of" operator on a variable with the register storage class, doesn't matter if it got stored on stack or a register.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
  register int num = 4;
  printf("num %p\n", &num);
}
```

Output:
```bash
test.c: In function ‘main’:
test.c:5:3: error: address of register variable ‘num’ requested
    5 |   printf("num %p\n", &num);
      |   ^~~~~~
```

### #3. Uninitialized block statics.

**Expectation**: `num` will be given storage in the `.bss` section and it will be initialized to zero.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
  static int num;
  printf("num (without an initializer): %d\n", num);
}
```

Generated assembly:
```asm
	.text
	.section .rodata
	.align 8
.LC0:
	.string	 "num (without an initializer): %d\n"

	.text
	.globl main
	.type  main, @function
main:
	push rbp
	mov  rbp, rsp

	mov  eax, DWORD PTR num.0[rip]
	mov  esi, eax          ; arg3
	lea  rax, .LC0[rip]
	mov  rdi, rax          ; arg2
	mov  eax, 0            ; arg1
	call printf@PLT

	mov eax, 0
	pop rbp
	ret

	.local num.0
	.comm  num.0, 4, 4
```

The output:
```
num (without an initializer): 0
```

Explanation of the directives:
  - `.local` is GAS directive used to create a symbol local to the assembly unit with the following syntax: `.local sym_name`
  - `.comm` reserves uninitialized common storage for a symbol with the following syntax: `.comm buffer, size_bytes, alignment`

~~ ***Questions*** ~~

Why there is no `.section .bss`?

- The compiler has multiple ways to reserve memory in `.bss`.

- The compiler might prefer one over the other given the priorities. Discussing this is out-of-scope of this writing.

Why `num` is changed to `num.0`?

- It prevents duplicate symbol error when variables with identical names in different blocks are given static storage. 

- For example, both `foo()` and `bar()` declaring a `static int count;`. Again, discussing that is out-of-scope of this writing.

### #4. Initialized Block Statics

**Expectation**: `num` will be given storage in the `.data` section and initialized with 45.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
	static int num = 45;
}
```

This is the assembly:
```asm
main:
	push rbp
	mov  rbp, rsp
	mov  eax, 0
	pop  rbp
	ret

	.data
	.align 4
	.type  num.0, @object
	.size  num.0, 4
num.0:
	.long	45
```

### #5. Zero-initialized Block Statics

**Expectation**: `num` will be given storage in the `.bss` section as it is zero-initialized.

Compile both the files.
```c
/* uninitialized.c */
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
  static int num;
}
```

```c
/* zero-initialized.c */
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
  static int num = 0;
}
```

This is the assembly:
```asm
main:
	push rbp
	mov  rbp, rsp
	mov  eax, 0
	pop  rbp
	ret

	.local num.0
	.comm  num.0, 4, 4
```
  - The assembly output is identical except for the filename. Use `diff` to double check.

### #6. Symbol Visibility

**Expectations**:

- num1: Global
- num2: Local
- num3: None

```c
#include <stdio.h>

int num1;
static int num2;

int main(void){
  int num3 = 4;
  printf("num3: %d\n", num3);
}
```

Use `readelf` to inspect symbol information in the generated binary. ***Note that it requires binutils on your system.***
```bash
→ readelf main -s | grep num 
   Num:    Value          Size Type    Bind   Vis      Ndx Name
    12: 0000000000004020     4 OBJECT  LOCAL  DEFAULT   25 num2
    29: 000000000000401c     4 OBJECT  GLOBAL DEFAULT   25 num1
```

### #7. The use of `extern`

`num.c` defines a variable with external linkage.
```c
/* num.c */
int num = 50;
```

`main.c` declares a `num` variable locally in the main(). Normally it would take precedence over the one with external linkage. However, when we specify that we would like to use the one with external linkage in the unnamed block, the source is built such that the `num` used in the unnamed block is the one present in `num.c`.
```c
/* main.c */
#include <stdio.h>

int main(void){
  int num = 4;

  printf("num: %d\n", num);

  {
    extern int num;
    printf("num: %d\n", num);
  }
}
```

The output:
```bash
→ gcc main.c num.c -o main
→ ./main
50
```

## #8. Modify the assembly to access a block-scoped declaration outside of it.

The following code calls the square function 4 times. The function has a variables that stores the number of calls made to the function. The function neither prints ncalls nor returns it. There is no way we can access it in C.
```c
#include <stdio.h>

void sq(int n){
  static int ncalls = 0;
  ncalls++ ;

  printf("The square of %d is %d\n", n, n*n);
}

int main(){
  sq(4);
  sq(5);
  sq(6);
  sq(7);
  printf("Number of calls made to sq() are \n");

  return 0;
}
```

This is the generated assembly.
```asm
	.file	"test.c"
	.intel_syntax noprefix
	.text
	.section .rodata
.LC0:
	.string	 "The square of %d is %d\n"

	.text
	.globl sq
	.type	 sq, @function
sq:
	push rbp
	mov  rbp, rsp
	sub  rsp, 16
	mov	DWORD PTR -4[rbp], edi

	mov	eax, DWORD PTR ncalls.0[rip]    # ncalls
	add	eax, 1                          # compute ncalls++
	mov	DWORD PTR ncalls.0[rip], eax    # update ncalls

	mov  eax, DWORD PTR -4[rbp]    # n
	imul eax, eax    # n*n
	mov  edx, eax    # arg4

	mov  eax, DWORD PTR -4[rbp]
	mov  esi, eax      # arg3 (n)

	lea  rax, .LC0[rip]
	mov  rdi, rax      # arg2 (string)

	mov  eax, 0        # arg1
	call printf@PLT

	nop
	leave
	ret

	.section .rodata
	.align 8
.LC1:
	.string	 "Number of calls made to sq() are \n"

	.text
	.globl main
	.type	 main, @function
main:
	push rbp
	mov  rbp, rsp

	mov  edi, 4
	call sq

	mov  edi, 5
	call sq

	mov  edi, 6
	call sq

	mov  edi, 7
	call sq

	lea  rax, .LC1[rip]
	mov  rdi, rax
	mov  eax, 0
	call printf@PLT

	mov	eax, 0
	pop	rbp
	ret

	.local ncalls.0
	.comm  ncalls.0,4,4

```

Add these lines after the last printf call.
```asm
	# convert integer to ASCII character
	mov eax, DWORD PTR ncalls.0[rip]
	add eax, 48    # '0'

	# push_ it to stack to get a memory address as 
	# rdi expects a buffer
	push rax

	# invoke sys_write
	mov rax, 1
	mov rdi, 1
	mov rsi, rsp
	mov rdx, 1
	syscall

	# clear the stack
	pop rax
```

Now build the assembly.
```bash
$ gcc main.s -o main
$ ./main

The square of 4 is 16
The square of 5 is 25
The square of 6 is 36
The square of 7 is 49
Number of calls made to sq() are 
4%
```
- Note that the % comes in zsh. In bash, you'd see the prompt instead, as there is no newline character.

This proves that assembly doesn't have block scope. It is the compiler that generates an assembly such that the C variable is not accessed outside of the equivalent assembly block.

## Things I have not covered.

While reading the ISO/IEC 9889:2024 standard draft, I found that `constexpr` and `typedef` are storage class specifiers too. I am honestly surprised and a little confused.

There is another storage class, called `thread_local`. Since I don't understand threads and concurrency yet, I can not verify anything, and I don't have any plans to explore this subsystem.

I may update these in future.

## Open Questions

There are some questions I don't have a definitive answer for. For some questions, I have observations and hypothesis. For others, I have no starting point.

They might be unusual or strange, but I'd like to explore them in future.

1. Why the **ISO/IEC 9889** standard doesn't define a proper term like "program scope" to denote program-wide availability of a C object?
2. Why assembly doesn't have a true block scope? What were the challenges that made the engineers not build something similar?
3. Why the identifiers that are stored on stack have no linkage. This one sounds very obvious, but I am very confused about it.
